This folder constains wavelength-dependent (and occaisionally spatially-dependent) transmission curve data for various components of the HSC optical system.  It is used by the installTransmissionCurves.py script
to create butler-managed datasets that are attached to Exposures during ISR.

M1-2010s.txt: mirror reflectivity as of the 2010 recoating (assumed spatially constant), downloaded from https://www.naoj.org/Observing/Telescope/Parameters/Reflectivity/M1-2010s.txt.

filterTraces.py: spatially-varying traces of the broadband filters, obtained by private communication from Satoshi Kawanomoto -> Robert Lupton -> Eli Rykoff.

qe_ccd_HSC.txt: sensor response (assumed spatially constant and common to all sensors), downloaded from https://www.naoj.org/Observing/Instruments/HSC/txt/qe_ccd_HSC.txt.
